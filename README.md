# Evolutionary-Scheduling

Implementation of five different types of evolutionary algorithms (default, 1st generation MA, 2nd generation MA with meme probabilities, 2nd generation MA with meme ordering, 2nd generation with meme probabilities and ordering) for the ITC2007 scheduling problems. 

## Usage
Use `python experiment.py` to run the program. Additional parameters for the number of individuals, number of generations, crossover probability, mutation probability, dataset, type of ea, number of repeats and name of experiment are available. See `python experiment.py -h` for more information.

## Results
Results are automatically saved after each run of the EA. The `logs` folder contains the results of an example run.
