Meet with elena:
- Representation: exams -> rooms/period
- Efficient evalutation of the fitness
- Approach: first get default EA running on on default problem. Then improve EA with memetics, then improve memetics
with our own method.

Todo:
- Implement all constraint functions: individual -> number
- Look at possibilities to repair individual

Questions:
- Probably the EA is faster with memetics, does it also improve on the found solution?
